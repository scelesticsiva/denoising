## Usage
### Datasets
Download [SIDD](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~kamel/sidd/dataset.php) and [DND](https://noise.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/) datasets, and modify `dataset_path` in `dataset/base.py` accordingly.
```
|- dataset_path
  |- SIDD
    |- SIDD_Medium_Srgb
      |- Data
        |- 0001_001_S6_00100_00060_3200_L
        |- 0002_001_S6_00100_00020_3200_N
        |- ...
    |- SIDD_Validation
      |- ValidationNoisyBlocksSrgb.mat
      |- ValidationGtBlocksSrgb.mat
    |- SIDD_Benchmark
      |- BenchmarkNoisyBlocksSrgb.mat
  |- DND
    |- info.mat
    |- images_srgb
```

### Validation
Validate on SIDD Validation dataset,
```
cd validate
python validate_SIDD.py
```
